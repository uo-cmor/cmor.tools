# cmor.tools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cmor.tools is to provide standardised tools to initialise a research project folder, undertake analysis, and generate output reports (journal manuscripts, etc.) for research projects undertken at CMOR.

## Installation

You can install cmor.tools from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nek-rwl/cmor.tools")
```

## Components

This section will describe the various main components included in the package.

* **create_research_project** This function (and related sub-routines) set up an R package, directory structure, and template files to hold the data, code, and output from a research project. This work is closely based on Ben Marwick's `rrtools` package.

* **tar_render_manuscript** This function is used in `targets` plans to generate rendered `.docx` output from a `.Rmd` file.
